Question 1: You would fit your automated tests within a GitHub action that runs whenever code is pushed. This is because you want to be able to fix issues that arise in smaller chunks (hence running whenever code is pushed) and automatically (hence why it is automated through a GitHub action).

Question 2: No, you would use unit testing to check if a function is returning the correct output. End-to-end testing is meant for emulating how a user would actually use the software.
